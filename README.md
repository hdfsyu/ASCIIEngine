# ASCIIEngine
bro is this lego island or a 3d game engine
# Compiling and Running
## Deps
Visual Studio 2017 (it has to be 2017 otherwise you will get code problems), the C/C++ support option for visual studio
## Compiling
Click on Build > Build Solution, and the executable will be in projectdir/x64/buildtarget/ASCIIEngine.exe
## Running
Click on Local Windows Debugger to start the game
# Notes
You can't play this in Windows Terminal, use an admin command prompt to play the game.

~I'm going to do a little rewrite of the code when this is finished.~

Rewrite is done!

You have to copy the objs directory which is located at projectdir/ASCIIEngine/objs in the same folder where the exe is located

There is a web version [here](https://hdfsyu.itch.io/ASCIIEngine)
# Features
Ability to load OBJ files!

Controls are arrow keys to move camera and go up and down, WASD to move camera and go forward and backwards.

~This all runs in the terminal!~

Fine, I lied. It's not completely ASCII (actually I don't think it even is ASCII) it WAS ASCII but now it isnt... :(
