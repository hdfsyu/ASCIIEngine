# ASCIIEngine
bro is this lego island or a 3d game engine
# Compiling and Running
## Deps
Visual Studio 2017 (it has to be 2017 otherwise you will get code problems), the C/C++ support option for visual studio
## Compiling
Click on Build > Build Solution, and the executable will be in projectdir/x64/buildtarget/ASCIIEngine.exe
## Running
Click on Local Windows Debugger to start the game
# Notes
No controls, because this is kinda a 3D demo

You can't play this in Windows Terminal, use an admin command prompt to play the game.

I'm going to do a little rewrite of the code when this is finished.

You have to copy the objs directory which is located at projectdir/ASCIIEngine/objs in the same folder where the exe is located
# Features
Ability to load OBJ files!

Soon... controls...

This all runs in the terminal!
